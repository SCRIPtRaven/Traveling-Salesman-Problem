# Traveling-Salesman-Problem
The Traveling Salesman Problem piqued my interesed when it was part of a university assignment, so I decided to create a visualized representation of the different solutions to this problem in Python using a GUI.

Implemented solutions:</br>
Greedy</br>
Randomized (not an actual solution, exists just for GUI testing at the moment)
